# linuxcnc_config
This repro is set up for me to keep track of the configfiles I 
use for my CMC milling machine (and others).

It is highly unlikely for anyone else to make use of these files
directly. But you might find bits an pieces that could help you
set up your CNC machine.

Short desciption of the configs:

ZX45 - my main setup for a CNC converted ZX45 3 axis milling machine
foam - Set up for a 4 axis (xy+uw) hot wire foam cutter I had.
